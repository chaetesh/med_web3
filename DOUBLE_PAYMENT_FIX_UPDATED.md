# Double Payment Fix - Updated

## Issue Description
After implementing the initial fix, users were still experiencing double payment requests from MetaMask. This required a more comprehensive solution to prevent the issue.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The race condition between state updates and UI interactions allowed multiple transaction requests to be sent
2. The modal wasn't completely resetting when closed or reopened
3. The parent component wasn't properly tracking payment state
4. Multiple clicks on the payment button could trigger multiple transactions

## Fixes Applied

### In PaymentModal.tsx
1. **Immediate transaction processing:**
   - Notify parent immediately after transaction is sent, don't wait for confirmation
   ```javascript
   // Update the success state immediately after transaction is sent
   setPaymentSuccess(true);
   setError(null);
   // Notify parent component of successful payment right away
   onPaymentComplete(tx.hash);
   ```

2. **Added protection against concurrent payments:**
   ```javascript
   // Prevent double payments by checking if we're already processing
   if (processing) {
     console.log('Payment already in progress, ignoring additional clicks');
     return;
   }
   ```

3. **Added state reset when modal closes:**
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (!isOpen) {
       // Reset all states when modal closes
       setProcessing(false);
       setError(null);
       setPaymentSuccess(false);
       setTransactionHash('');
     }
   }, [isOpen]);
   ```

4. **Enhanced close button handling:**
   ```javascript
   <button 
     onClick={() => {
       // Reset states and close modal
       setProcessing(false);
       setError(null);
       setPaymentSuccess(false);
       onClose();
     }}
     className="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700"
   >
     âœ•
   </button>
   ```

### In GeneticRiskAssessmentList.tsx
1. **Added payment tracking state:**
   ```javascript
   const [paymentInProgress, setPaymentInProgress] = useState<boolean>(false);
   ```

2. **Prevent showing modal if payment is in progress:**
   ```javascript
   if (paymentInProgress) {
     console.log('Payment already in progress, ignoring click');
     return;
   }
   ```

3. **Immediate modal closing and delayed state reset:**
   ```javascript
   // First thing: immediately close the modal to prevent double payments
   setShowPaymentModal(false);
   
   // Keep payment in progress flag for a bit to prevent immediate re-clicks
   // Reset after 5 seconds
   setTimeout(() => {
     setPaymentInProgress(false);
   }, 5000);
   ```

## Benefits of the Fix
- Prevents duplicate transactions from being initiated
- Ensures proper state reset between payment attempts
- Provides a safeguard against rapid consecutive clicks
- Creates a clean payment flow without race conditions
- Modal state is properly reset when closed and reopened

## Additional Improvements
- Transaction confirmation is now handled asynchronously in the background
- The UI immediately shows success after transaction is sent
- Added a 5-second cooldown period after payment to prevent accidental re-clicks
